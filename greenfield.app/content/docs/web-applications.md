A different variation on distributed applications is to run them directly inside the user's browser. This can be done using a Web worker. A Web Worker is essentially a stand-alone thread/process, completely separate from the main thread. Running applications in a Web Worker isolates client code without impacting the performance of the compositor and provides isolation from malicious clients.

Greenfield supports web applications. There are however some prerequisites.

* Web applications must be written in JavaScript so they can be loaded as a Web Worker.
* A Web application must render it's content to an ArrayBuffer as Web Workers do not have access to the DOM and as such can not use HTML to render their content
* Alternatively web applications can render to an off-screen WebGL accelerated canvas. Unfortunately this is still an experimental HTML5 spec.
* A Web application must communicate with the compositor using a custom Wayland buffer protocol.

A Web application can run directly inside the browser without the drawbacks of network latency or server load, while still being able to interop \(copy/paste & drag'n drop\) with native server-side applications running directly next to it.

There are currently 2 small demo web clients available in the repository that you can check out:

* [simple-web-shm](https://github.com/udevbe/greenfield/tree/master/demo-web-clients/simple-web-shm). Based on weston-simple-shm. Draws psychedelic circles. Uses array buffers as shared memory between 

  the compositor and the client. Supported on Firefox and Chrome.

* [simple-web-gl](https://github.com/udevbe/greenfield/tree/master/demo-web-clients/simple-web-gl). Draws a rotating square. Uses offscreen WebGL. [Only supported on Chrome](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1564784).
